You are an expert in software architecture and product design.
You have a vast knowledge of the Farm Credit system, are are particularly versed in how Loan and Collateral interact within the Farm Credit system.
You understand the collateral evaluation process and how that process is performed within Farm Credit
You understand the idea of technical debt and how using old technologies creates technical debt.

There are 3 conversation logs located in "C:\AI Projects\AI Collateral Review\Original Documents\AI Requirements Eval".  I need those 3 conversations evaluated for commonalities.
The evaluation needs to take all of the requirements into account located in "C:\AI Projects\AI Collateral Review\Original Documents\CollateralKnowledgeFiles" as well.
This product will need to interact with some legacy systems using APIs, so we need to ensure that the data can flow in and out of the product.
Give me a summary of all of the requirements provided, combining similar ideas where we can.
The format should have the Feature Name as the title, a plain language description of the feature, the difficulty of implementation using tools such as Windsurf, and whether or not the item is a must have, nice to have, or backlog item for the first release of the product.

Make sure that the following are all accounted for within the evaluation:
I am trying to create solution for collateral analysis for users within a farm credit association
The audience for the app is the staff at the farm credit association, referred to as users
When we refer to customers, they are the borrowers who have loan and collateral details currently in an existing system
Customers do not have any access to this solution
A record is the set of details stored in the database about the collateral, account, or loan
The solution should integrate with an existing database to retrieve loan and account data
There will be calculations performed that are specific to each farm credit association
There are certain features that are required, including:
-Users should be able to create new collateral records
-Users should be able to edit collateral records
-Users should not be able to edit loan records or account records shown in the solution
-Users should be able to link new collateral records to existing loan records
-Users should be able to search for existing collateral records
-Users should be able to see a visual representation of the loans and collateral associated with an account
-Users should be able to see a web of liability for customers
-Users should be able to simulate changes to collateral allocations to loans to see what effect the change would have on the web of liability
-Users should be able to create reports on data within the solution

The system key value determinations of market value and net realizable value (NRV)

Appraisal methods supported include comparable market valuation, benchmark per acre valuations, and income-based methodologies

Associations can establish net realizable value rules by collateral type or other attributes

Users should be able to set lien positions of loans against collateral

Association may have custom NRV rules based on lien position and whether the prior lien holder is a Farm Credit entity or an outside lender

The system records census tract, flood map, water district, etc. GIS type information and allows monitoring / reporting based on that information

Users can import and/or enter collateral information germane to property tax information and integration with escrow reporting is supported

Specifically authorized users can perform Portfolio valuation updates can be done based on benchmark valuation updates and applied to all related collateral properties, which in turn updates the related L/AV, L/NRV, and LGD calculations

Users can generate a report for internal use that may include information that is not presented to the customers (e.g., NRV methodologies)

Users can generate a report for external sharing with the customers that is formatted differently than the internal report

Users should be able to generate an appraisal update request and initiate a workflow request

Authorized Users should be able to perform portfolio level efficiency and bottleneck analysis of collateral updates, time to market, accuracy, etc.

Mapping related data integration (GPS coordinates, Census Tracts, etc.)

Flood map integration / overlay

Water District integration / mapping / overlay

Region collateral / loan concentration analysis

Collateral Benchmarking

Visual presentation of relationships between property-owners-legal documents

Requirements from Code Analysis/Visual Analysis

Users should be able to create new collateral records

Users should be able to edit collateral records

Users should not be able to edit loan records or account records shown in the solution

Users should be able to link new collateral records to existing loan records

Users should be able to search for existing collateral records

Users should be able to see a visual representation of the loans and collateral associated with an account

Users should be able to see a web of liability for customers

Users should be able to simulate changes to collateral allocations to loans to see what effect the change would have on the web of liability

Users should be able to create reports on data within the solution

When linking a loan and collateral, certain data should be included on those links, including:
-The lien position for the collateral to loan
-Whether or not there is an Abundance of Caution on the link

On the Loan records, data should be shown for the "Loan to Value" ratio, both the Actual Value and the Net Realizable Value

We need to have some sort of collateral benchmarking as part of the solution
