## Implementation Considerations

1. There needs to be an evaluation on how the changeover to the new system will affect existing FPI partner systems.
2. Financial Services Cloud (Salesforce) projects will need to be updated to use the new system. Whether this is during their go-live or after is unknown.
3. **Customizability**: Ensure configurability for different Farm Credit associations
