Pinning an Object

Business Requirements:

Create a “Pinning” feature that allows the user to pin objects on the collateral canvas which will focus and highlight 
linked relationships. This will allow the user to focus in on the specific loans or collateral they want to work on and 
streamline a potentially busy screen into something more manageable and user friendly. 




Must Have’s:

When the user hovers their mouse pointer over objects on the collateral canvas, a push pin button will appear in place 
of the mouse pointer. 

NOTE: This will only apply on objects that are allowed to be pinned.





Clicking the “Push Pin” button will pin that object into focus and will outline the linked relationships in that items color 
AND change the links to show as solid lines.


The following objects are brought to foreground when an object is pinned: 

Loan 


Security Document


Collateral 


Collateral Detail 


Customer 





When an objected is pinned all non-related items fade to the background. This would include:

Location Object (Even if this was linked, this is for streamline purposes)


Any other objects that are not directly linked to the object you pinned.

So ALL Loan, Security Document, Collateral, Collateral Detail, Collateral Owner and Collateral Location objects 
will disappear from the collateral canvas if they are NOT linked to the object the user pins.








When an object is pinned, all remaining objects are centered and centrally aligned.


Objects that can be pinned on the Collateral Canvas:

Loan Object


Security Document Object


Collateral Object





Objects that cannot be pinned are:

Collateral Detail


Collateral Owner


Collateral Location
