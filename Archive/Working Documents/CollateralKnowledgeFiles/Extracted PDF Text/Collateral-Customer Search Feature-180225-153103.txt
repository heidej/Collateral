Customer Search Feature

Business Requirement:

Create a Customer Search Feature that will allow ACA users to search for existing customers and open their collateral 
records. 




Functional Requirements:

Must Have’s:

The customer search feature should be available always, no matter where a user navigates within the application. At 
minimum this should include:

The Home Screen


Within a customer’s collateral structure (scenario)





The search would be performed by entering a Customer Name into the “search” field and hitting “enter” on the 
keyboard or hitting a “Search” button.


Results of the search should include all exact matches, near-matches to the customer name entered, or recently 
opened customers.


The user may then click on the particular customer from the search results and would be launched into that customers 
collateral structure (scenario).




Nice to Have’s:

Create a “Tool Tip” pop-up feature that allows the user to hover their mouse over customers from their search results. 
When the mouse is hovered over the customer name, it will display information containing:

Customer Name


Address


Phone


Files As name


Associated Branch


Last four digits of the tax identification number





Create an Advanced Search feature. The search feature would allow a user to search for a customer against broad or 
specific information such as:

Branch


Loan Officer


Account Number


Employee Relationship


Loan Number


Loan Name


Takedown Name


Product Package
