The below content contains requirements for a collateral application for Farm Credit.  As experts in Farm Credit and how collateral is used within that ecosystem, we need recommendations on how to build a collateral product.    There are some additional prompt details in the file that should help.  We want to make sure that we incorporate using agents to make users' lives easier and add automation, so please rely on the AI Designer for that input.

I am trying to create solution for collateral analysis for users within a farm credit association
The audience for the app is the staff at the farm credit association, referred to as users
When we refer to customers, they are the borrowers who have loan and collateral details currently in an existing system
Customers do not have any access to this solution
A record is the set of details stored in the database about the collateral, account, or loan
The solution should integrate with an existing database to retrieve loan and account data
There will be calculations performed that are specific to each farm credit association
There are certain features that are required, including:
-Users should be able to create new collateral records
-Users should be able to edit collateral records
-Users should not be able to edit loan records or account records shown in the solution
-Users should be able to link new collateral records to existing loan records
-Users should be able to search for existing collateral records
-Users should be able to see a visual representation of the loans and collateral associated with an account
-Users should be able to see a web of liability for customers
-Users should be able to simulate changes to collateral allocations to loans to see what effect the change would have on the web of liability
-Users should be able to create reports on data within the solution

The system key value determinations of market value and net realizable value (NRV)

Appraisal methods supported include comparable market valuation, benchmark per acre valuations, and income-based methodologies

Associations can establish net realizable value rules by collateral type or other attributes

Users should be able to set lien positions of loans against collateral

Association may have custom NRV rules based on lien position and whether the prior lien holder is a Farm Credit entity or an outside lender

The system records census tract, flood map, water district, etc. GIS type information and allows monitoring / reporting based on that information

Users can import and/or enter collateral information germane to property tax information and integration with escrow reporting is supported

Specifically authorized users can perform Portfolio valuation updates can be done based on benchmark valuation updates and applied to all related collateral properties, which in turn updates the related L/AV, L/NRV, and LGD calculations

Users can generate a report for internal use that may include information that is not presented to the customers (e.g., NRV methodologies)

Users can generate a report for external sharing with the customers that is formatted differently than the internal report

Users should be able to generate an appraisal update request and initiate a workflow request

Authorized Users should be able to perform portfolio level efficiency and bottleneck analysis of collateral updates, time to market, accuracy, etc.

Mapping related data integration (GPS coordinates, Census Tracts, etc.)

Flood map integration / overlay

Water District integration / mapping / overlay

Region collateral / loan concentration analysis

Collateral Benchmarking

Visual presentation of relationships between property-owners-legal documents

Requirements from Code Analysis/Visual Analysis

Users should be able to create new collateral records

Users should be able to edit collateral records

Users should not be able to edit loan records or account records shown in the solution

Users should be able to link new collateral records to existing loan records

Users should be able to search for existing collateral records

Users should be able to see a visual representation of the loans and collateral associated with an account

Users should be able to see a web of liability for customers

Users should be able to simulate changes to collateral allocations to loans to see what effect the change would have on the web of liability

Users should be able to create reports on data within the solution

When linking a loan and collateral, certain data should be included on those links, including:
-The lien position for the collateral to loan
-Whether or not there is an Abundance of Caution on the link

On the Loan records, data should be shown for the "Loan to Value" ratio, both the Actual Value and the Net Realizable Value

We need to have some sort of collateral benchmarking as part of the solution
