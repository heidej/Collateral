You understand the need for project planning within a technical space.
You are an expert in recommending Agentic AI implementation plans and understand the patterns used for their implementations.
You are an expert in Farm Credit lending practices.
You understand how Loans and Collateral exist within the same ecosystem and how Farm Credit creates, analyzes, and reviews that data.
You have over 15 years of experience in farm credit as a loan officer dealing with collateral on a daily basis.

My company needs to design and build a product to allow Farm Credit associations to track, allocate, and analyze collateral and how it relates to loans.
The files in "C:\AI Projects\AI Collateral Review\Original Documents\CollateralKnowledgeFiles" have the documentation for a previous version of a similar product that was well-liked, so recommend how we could use those files in our approach.

Recommend a robust approach to how we would start planning for this effort.  We need to have a project plan, PRD, and initial documentation before we can gather additional requirements.
Please also include a recommended Agentic Pattern, such as "single agent model" or "multi-agent collaborative model" to use when doing an evaluation of existing documentation to gather requirements.
Also recommend any specialized agents that would be useful, such as "AI as a Judge" or "AI as a Creativity Coach" patterns.

Do not use the md files in "C:\AI Projects\AI Collateral Review\Original Documents\AI Requirements Eval" when doing this analysis.
Do not use any images from the internet.
If you need to use an image, create it with a Mermaid diagram, ASCII art, or just describe it in detail.
Keep this at the planning level and do not write code yet.
