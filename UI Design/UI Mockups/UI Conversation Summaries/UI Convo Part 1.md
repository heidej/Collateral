## Implementation Details

### File Structure
The entire implementation is contained in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript:
```
c:\AI Projects\AI Collateral Review\UI Design\UI Mockups\web-of-liability.html
```

### Code Organization
The file contains:
- CSS styles (lines 1-516): Dashboard styling, node styling, details panel, etc.
- HTML structure (lines 517-647): Sidebar, header, visualization container, etc.
- JavaScript (lines 648-1200+): D3.js implementation for the visualization

### Key JavaScript Functions
- `createVisualization()`: Creates the main visualization with nodes and links
- `showDetailsPanel(node)`: Displays details for a selected node 
- `hideDetailsPanel()`: Collapses the details panel
- `updateVisualization()`: Adjusts the visualization when window size changes
- `updateNodePositions()`: Updates node positions when layout changes

### Data Structure
- **Nodes:** Array of objects with properties like id, name, label, type, x, y
- **Links:** Array of objects defining connections with source, target, value, risk
- **Node Types:** "loan", "real-estate", "account", "equipment", "livestock"
- **Risk Levels:** Normal and "high" (for high-risk connections)

## Visualization Implementation

### D3.js Implementation
- D3.js v7 is used for the visualization
- SVG-based nodes (rectangular) with color coding by type
- Links rendered as lines with styling based on risk level
- Column-based layout with headers for each section

### Node Styling
```css
.node-text {
    font-size: 11px;
    font-weight: bold;
    fill: black;  /* Changed from white to black */
    text-anchor: middle;
    pointer-events: none;
}
```

### Node Dimensions
Nodes are 108px × 48px rectangles (increased by 20% from original 90px × 40px)
```javascript
nodeGroup.append("rect")
    .attr("x", d => d.x - 54)  // Increased by 20% from -45
    .attr("y", d => d.y - 24)  // Increased by 20% from -20
    .attr("width", 108)        // Increased by 20% from 90
    .attr("height", 48)        // Increased by 20% from 40
```

### Column Layout
```javascript
// Current column structure (3 columns)
const columns = [
    { x: 0, width: columnWidth, label: "Loans" },
    { x: columnWidth, width: columnWidth, label: "Collateral" },
    { x: columnWidth * 2, width: columnWidth, label: "Accounts" }
];
```

## Pending Items and Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Filtering Capabilities:** Implement functionality for the "Filter Relationships" button
2. **Add Node Functionality:** Make "Add Collateral" and "Add Loan" buttons functional
3. **Zoom Functionality:** Implement zoom in/out buttons
4. **Data Integration:** Connect to real data source instead of static sample data
5. **Responsive Enhancements:** Further optimize for different screen sizes
6. **Performance Optimization:** For larger datasets with many nodes and links

### Known Issues
None currently reported, but the following areas might need attention:
- Node overlap in the consolidated collateral column with many items
- Ensuring links properly update when layout changes
- Testing across different browsers and screen sizes

## Continuation Instructions
To continue development on this project:
1. Open the primary HTML file at `c:\AI Projects\AI Collateral Review\UI Design\UI Mockups\web-of-liability.html`
2. Consider implementing one of the potential enhancements in the "Next Steps" section
3. Maintain the current visual design principles and user preferences
4. Test any changes by opening the HTML file directly in a browser

## Initial Requirements

The primary objective was to update the visualization to resemble a dashboard with the following components:
- A sidebar for navigation
- A structured header with breadcrumb navigation and action buttons
- A clearly organized visualization area for displaying relationships between different financial entities

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Dashboard Structure Implementation

#### Sidebar Implementation
- Created a dark-themed sidebar with white text for better contrast
- Added navigation links to key sections:
  - Dashboard
  - New Collateral
  - Web of Liability
  - Search
