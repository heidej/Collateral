Automatic Save Functionality (Plus Visual Indication)

Business Requirements:

Create framework so that as create/edit/delete changes are made, these will be automatically saved. In the case of 
creating through a data wizard, it will save upon completion of the wizard. Described further here: Data Wizards for 
data entry - Collateral Object 


Visually display on the collateral canvas that all edits/changes/delete changes have been saved.




Functional Requirements:

Must Have’s: Automatic Save Functionality

An automatic “Save” will be triggered for the user on the current collateral canvas they are viewing/editing when they 
make an addition, edit or deletion of data.

Optional trigger: If a customer/collateral canvas is closed, an automatic “Save” event will be triggered. (Do we 
need this?)







Must Have’s: Visual “Save” Indicator

Create a visual indication on the collateral canvas that any changes the user has made has been saved. 


A visual indicator will display when a “Save” event has been triggered from the rules indicated in Functionality #1 
above. 


The visual “Save” indicator will say “Changes have been saved at 12:37pm,” in the top right side of the collateral 
canvas.


The “Save” indicator will display on the collateral canvas permanently until another change is made, or the 
customer/collateral canvas is closed.

If an additional change is made on an existing collateral canvas that has previously been saved, the message from 
#4 will still display, but the time will update to the time of the current “Save” event. (ie, 1:03pm)







Non-Functional Requirements:

Create a “right-of-way” roadmap for whose “Save” truly gets saved when more than one user is in a customer’s 
collateral canvas at the same time. (Would a forced refresh help with this?)




Screenshots of “Potential” functionality: (NOTE: These screenshots are for example only 
and could change based on decisions made during development)
