Relationship Managers / Account Managers
Focus: Managing client relationships and ensuring that all relevant loan and collateral data is accessible.
Why They Care: They need a clear, holistic picture of each client’s liabilities and assets to provide better service, answer client questions, and identify cross-selling or upselling opportunities.
Loan Officers / Credit Analysts
Focus: Evaluating loan applications, approving credit limits, and monitoring ongoing loan performance.
Why They Care: Having a consolidated view of how collateral ties to multiple loans and accounts helps them accurately assess risk, maintain coverage ratios, and spot potential gaps or exposures.
Underwriters
Focus: Setting and enforcing underwriting standards, ensuring the bank’s policies and risk tolerance are upheld.
Why They Care: They need to confirm that any collateral pledged adequately secures the loans and that all relationships (e.g., co-borrowers, guarantors) are captured accurately. A connected view highlights where additional documentation or scrutiny may be required.
Risk Managers / Portfolio Managers
Focus: Overseeing overall credit risk, concentration risks, and exposure across the organization.
Why They Care: They benefit from a macro-level “web of liability” view to identify large borrowers or groups of interrelated borrowers whose combined obligations might pose systemic risk.
Compliance Officers / Auditors
Focus: Ensuring that internal policies and regulatory requirements (e.g., Dodd-Frank, Basel accords, Farm Credit Administration regulations) are followed.
Why They Care: They need to see how loans are collateralized and confirm that all documentation, liens, and risk management processes meet external and internal compliance standards.
Executives / Senior Management
Focus: Strategic oversight, financial performance, and governance.
Why They Care: Having a high-level overview of how different loans and accounts interrelate is crucial for decision-making around capital allocation, product strategies, and organizational risk posture.
System Administrators / Data Stewards
Focus: Maintaining data integrity, managing user access, and ensuring system uptime.
Why They Care: They need to ensure the application is secure, data is consistent, and that appropriate levels of access control are applied (especially important for sensitive financial data).
Appraisers / Valuation Specialists (Depending on organizational structure)
Focus: Providing accurate collateral valuations and ensuring those valuations remain current.
Why They Care: They may need to identify which collateral items are linked to which loans and see how changes in valuations propagate through the web of liability.
Legal Counsel
Focus: Overseeing legal documentation, lien positions, and potential litigation or default scenarios.
Why They Care: In the event of default or dispute, counsel needs to clearly understand and demonstrate which loans are tied to which collateral and how liability flows across interconnected accounts.
